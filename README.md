Fake reviews are increasingly distorting customer choices and damaging brand credibility on online platforms, making review authenticity essential for a fair marketplace. 
Indicators such as review content, user activity patterns, and metadata can reveal fraudulent submissions. Manual and rule‑based detection methods, however, are slow and often inaccurate. 
Today, AI and machine learning models trained on historical data automate this process, classifying reviews as genuine or fake with high precision. 
This report explores several machine learning approaches for fake review detection, compares their performance, and assesses their real‑world applicability, with the goal of identifying 
the most accurate and scalable solution for mitigating review fraud.
